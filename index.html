          Yo, we did a good amount of work dis year. Kinda crazy just how much work we got done. I already knew a good amount of HTML and CSS coming into this class but Web Design allowed me to develop these skills even more. I had a lot of practive making websites and using github. I had a lot of fun during this class and it was really educational and would recommend it to a friend.
